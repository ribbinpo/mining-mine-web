&emsp;Mining Mine Bot is a web service developed in Golang using the Fiber framework. It provides APIs for data fetching, storage, visualization, and analysis of cryptocurrency prices, specifically focusing on tokens traded on the P2P Binance exchange. The project utilizes cron jobs to periodically fetch price data, which is then stored in a database. Clients can access this data via the REST API to perform various tasks such as retrieving data, finding the best prices, and potentially implementing machine learning algorithms for further analysis.
